# SiteGenesis Tests
We're launching a new client-side testing strategy for SiteGenesis. It will include:

- functional tests that make sure the application's features are working correctly
- unit tests
- the ability to run all tests on the command-line with a build tool (gulp and grunt), with flexible reporting output

### Application vs Unit Tests
As an application, SG requires thorough testing on both the unit level as well as application level. With recent efforts to modularize client-side code, unit tests will make our modules more reliable. They will also allow custom implementations of SG to reuse our modules.

At the same time, we also need to deliver on a smooth ecommerce experience, and that is where application/ user interface (UI) tests come in. It will cover high level usecases and complex ecommerce scenarios, as well as demonstrate functionalities enabled by our platform.

## Test architecture
### Mocha
We use [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) as the primary framework to run tests on node.js and in the browser. Mocha really excels in making asynchronous actions easy, supporting both callback style and promise-based APIs.

### WebdriverIO
[WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io) provides bindings for WebDriver protocols in JavaScript. Not only does it provide a simple and clean API to work with, it also integrates nicely with different Selenium drivers for Chrome, Firefox and PhantomJS browsers and support services like SauceLabs that could enable tests to be run on a wide variety of browsers.

### Build tools
All current build tools that are supported in SiteGenesis, namely npm run scripts, gulp and grunt, will be able to run application and unit tests.

### Directory structure

```shell
test
├── README.md
├── application
│   ├── homepage
│   │   └── general.js
│   ├── productDetails
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── webdriver
│       ├── wdio.conf.js
│       ├── config.json
│       └── config.sample.json
└── unit
└── util
	└── index.js

```
Above is the structure of our tests. The main `test` directory lives in the root folder of SG application. In it will be `application` and `unit` directories.

Application tests' webdriver configurations are in the `webdriver` directory.

The tests are contained in suites, which are represented as directories. For example, the above structure contains Application test suites `homepage` and `productDetails`, and Unit test suite `util`.

## Test Setup

1. Install all dependencies

        :; npm install

1. Install phantomjs and standalone Selenium driver

        :; npm install -g phantomjs # see note [1]
        :; npm install --production -g selenium-standalone@latest
        :; selenium-standalone install

1. Use a WebDAV client (i.e. Cyberduck at https://cyberduck.io/) to upload the
**demo_data_no_hires_images/inventory-lists/inventory/inventory*.xml** files to the "**Impex/src/testdata/inventory-list/**"
directory of your sandbox (https://&lt;sandbox_host&gt;/on/demandware.servlet/webdav/Sites/Impex/src/testdata/inventory-list/).
You will need to login with a valid Business Manager account that has been
assigned the role of Administrator.

1. Add the `app_storefront_pipelines` cartridge to the Effective Cartridge Path of the Business Manager Sites-Site
Settings:
    1. Go to **Business Manager > Administration > Manage Sites**
    1. Click on the Manage the **Business Manager** Site link
    1. Set the **Cartridges** field to **app_storefront_pipelines:bm_custom_plugin**

1. Update site url config and desired browser client in `test/application/webdriver/config.json`. For example:

        {
            "url": "https://example.demandware.net/s/SiteGenesis",
            "client": "phantomjs"
        }

    *Note: please use Storefront URL format for application tests, but without the ending `/home` part.*

These 5 steps only need to be performed once.

## Run the tests

### Unit tests

```shell
:; npm run test:unit
```

### Application tests

#### Option 1: run your own selenium server
Start selenium server each time you wish to run the tests.

```shell
:; selenium-standalone start
```

It's important to keep this command-line instance running in the background. Open a new terminal window for next steps. For more information, see http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/install.html

```shell
:; npm run test:application
```

This command runs all the test suites by default. In order to run specific test suite(s), you can specify from the command line, for eg. `npm run test:application -- --suite home` or `npm run test:application -- --suite account/address.js`.
Other configuration options are also available, see below.

#### Option 2: use docker-selenium
Instead of running your own selenium server in the background, you could have one spun up automatically for you using docker.

To use this option, please make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

```shell
:; npm run test:application:docker
```

A note for **OS X** and **Windows** users: most likely your docker daemon is running on a separate IP address. You can pass this address in through the `--host` flag.
For example, if you're using `docker-machine` running a docker VM called `dev`, then you would do something like this:

```shell
:; npm run test:application:docker -- --host $(docker-machine ip dev)
```
If you're using boot2docker, then just replace `docker-machine ip dev` with `boot2docker ip`.

##### Debug
If you want to visually look at what the browser is doing for your tests, you can do so with the `--debug` flag.

```shell
:; npm run test:application:docker -- --host $(docker-machine ip dev) --suite account --debug
```
This will expose the docker selenium node via VNC port 5900. On OS X, it will also open the VNC session via Screen Sharing.

### Test Data Reset

To ensure that the application tests can consistently compare results with their expected values, we have implemented a process to reset test data.  During the SiteGenesis build process, a job called, **TestDataReset**, is created and available to run.  **Note:** By default, the site associated with the job is SiteGenesis.
If you are using a different site, please alter the job to point to it.

Before running a test, please reset the data by following these steps:

1. Go to **Business Manager > Administration > Job Schedules**
2. Click on the **TestDataReset** link, which will redirect you to the Job Detail page.
3. Click the Run button, wait a moment, then periodically click the Refresh button under the **TestDataReset - History** section until the Status column reports **Finished**.  The Error column should display **None**.  At this point, you can run the application tests.

### Options
The following options are supported on the command line:

- `reporter`: (default: `spec`) see [all available options](http://mochajs.org/#reporters).
- `timeout`: (default: `60000`)
- `suite`: (default: `all`)
- `client`: (default: `chrome`) browser environment to run UI tests in
- `url`: (default: 'https://staging-stage03-dw.demandware.net/s/SiteGenesis')
- 'locale': (default:'x_default')
- 'coverage': (default:'smoke')

### Test user accounts

Here are some generic test accounts that are used in the application tests suite,
along with their differences for testing different scenarios:
**Note**: The password for each account is **Test123!**

# Troubleshooting

1. **Couldn't connect to selenium server error**

    This is likely due to the Selenium server not being started.  Assuming that
    `npm install` has already been run, from a Terminal, please type:
    `selenium-standalone start`

1. **Tests have been succeeding, and with no code changes, tests are suddenly
failing**

    - Has the TestDataReset job been run?  It is possible that a test has been
      run so often that inventory values have been depleted, and certain options
      are no longer available.

    - Another potential area to check is whether Promises in before and beforeEach
      hooks are prepended with `return` as this is needed by Mocha as part of
      its Promises implementation.

1. **Other Tips**

    - Check the Selenium log in the Terminal where `selenium-standalone start`
      was executed for potential clues as to what may have occurred when a
      test failed.
